# React Portfolio

## Description
Hello! This is the react portfolio I made for module 20. Given that there isn't much time left with class, I didn't get to use all the components I found online that were cool, however I tried my best to make a smooth, clean site.

## Installation
This requires create-react-app and react-scrolls

## Deployed link
[here is the website so far!](https://fairiberry.github.io/react-portfolio/)
